A long time has passed since my last blogpost. A lot has happened since then.  
I moved the blog to a new Website, which I intend to use as a general purpose website for myself. The blog will be one part of this site. I want to post semi regularly again and give short updates on the projects i will be working on in the foreseeable future. Maybe I will also add more guides to the guide section of the new site.

Concerning my bachelors thesis. A lot happened since the last post. We decided to leave blender behind as it proved to complicated to work with. We switched to NVIDIA's lightweight rendering framewor [Falcor](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/Falcor), which proved a lot easier to understand and adapt. At the time I write this post I already finished my thesis and received my bachelors degree. You can read all about it in my publicated thesis ["Incemental Updates of Path-Traced Scenes during Editing"](https://pascalhann.github.io/publication/2022-04-01-Incremental-Updates-of-Path-Traced-Scenes-during-Editing).
