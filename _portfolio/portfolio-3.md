The austrian tabletop league "Supernova" is a group of players competing against each other in a friendly environment in monthly matches. Each month the army sizes increase so that new players have the chance to build up their armies while learning the game through competing in the league.

I provide the league with a basic static website built with jekyll, hosted on github that gives an overview of the players, matchups and rankings of the league.
