PeacefulPlayerRepacified (PPR) is a Minecraft bukkit Server plugin I developed and maintain.
It is based on an original Plugin from [Owen Oclee](https://github.com/owenoclee), who kindly gave me permission to use his source code.

**Description:**  
PPR allows admins of minecraft servers to have both peaceful and non peaceful players on the same server. For people who don't know what that means: In Minecraft there are hostile mobs, that attack players. For players who don't enjoy this aspect of the game the developers introduced peaceful mode which removes all hostile mobs from the game. Now what if you have different preferences of playstyle present for different players on a server? This is where my plugin comes in. With it, specific players can be flagged as peaceful, meaning they will not be attacked by hostile mobs. This allows both playstyles on the same server.
