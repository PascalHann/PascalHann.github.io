A small game that me and some colleagues developed as part of the Global Game Jam 2022.

**Synopsis:**  
In a world ridden of climate change and horrendous rent, youths have no other option but to mine Bitcoin while simultaneously preserving endangered biospheres. Build a BTC mining farm that also hosts rare algae and fish to make money and safe the planet!
